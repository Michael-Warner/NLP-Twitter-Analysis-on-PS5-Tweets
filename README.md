## Purpose:
The purpose of this project was to connect to Twitter's API and to track customer sentiments about the PS5 after it was launched on Nov 12, 2020. 

## Dataset:
The dataset was pulled from public tweets through Twitter for the period of 4 days, January 15th, 2021 to January 18th, 2021. There was 4962 tweets with the hashtag PS5 in that four day period.

## Method:
The methodology used was an EDA on the dataset, data cleaning, feature engineering and then an analysis on the sentiment of consumers for the PS5.

## Results:

1) Evening time has the highest amount of tweets of PS5 when twitter users are more active.
2) Majority of PS5 tweets are from the US or the UK, especially in London and California
3) Over 85% of PS5 tweets come from different platforms of Twitter, the rest are from 
   official PlayStation and third-party social media management service providers.
4) The main topic of PS5 is about gaming, some of the most frequently used words are
   about PS5 itself directly and the competitors.
5) The hashtags that appear frequently are related to PS5 device and its competitors, 
   game streaming, and name of the games.
6) In general, thereâ€˜re more negative emotions than positive ones on our Twitter dataset.
7) Most of the positive words expressed user's support for the PS5 launch.
8) Negative emotions are more about insufficient stock of PS5 and some product issues.

## Conclusion:

The overall sentiment of PS5 during that time period was more negative than positive. This is connected to lack of user support during the PS5 launch and the lack of avaliablity of the consoles.
