## Purpose:
The purpose of this project was to connect to Twitter's API and to track customer sentiments about the PS5 after it was launched on Nov 12, 2020. 

## Dataset:
The dataset was pulled from public tweets through Twitter for the period of 4 days, January 15th, 2021 to January 18th, 2021. There were 4962 tweets with the hashtag PS5 in that four day period.

## Method:
The methodology used was an EDA on the dataset, data cleaning, feature engineering and then an analysis on the sentiment of consumers for the PS5.

## Results:

1)Evening time had the highest number of tweets of PS5 when twitter users were more active.
2)Majority of PS5 tweets were from the US or the UK, especially in London and California.
3)Over 85% of PS5 tweets came from different platforms of Twitter, the rest were from official PlayStation and third-party social media management service providers.
4)The main topic of PS5 was about gaming, some of the most frequently used words were about PS5 itself directly and their competitors.
5)The hashtags that appeared frequently were related to the PS5 device and its competitors, game streaming, and name of the games.
6)In general, there were more negative emotions than positive ones on the Twitter dataset.
7)Most of the positive words expressed user's support for the PS5 launch.
8)Negative emotions were more about insufficient stock of PS5 and some product issues.


## Conclusion:

The overall sentiment of PS5 during that time period was more negative than positive. This was connected to lack of user support during the PS5 launch and the lack of availability of the consoles.
